# Mix

If you are familiar with Ruby, Mix is **bundler, RubyGems, and Rake combined**

## New projects

When we are ready to create a new Elixir project, Mix makes it easy with the `mix new` command.
This will generate our project's folder structure and necessary boilerplate. This is prett straighforward

```shellscript
$ mix new example
```

From the output we can see that Mix has created our directory and a number of boilerplate files:

```
* creating README.md
* creating .formatter.exs
* creating .gitignore
* creating mix.exs
* creating lib
* creating lib/example.ex
* creating test
* creating test/test_helper.exs
* creating test/example_test.exs
```

Now, we are going to focus _our attention on `mix.exs`_
Here we configure our application, dependencies, environment, and version.

> You can see all the structure on the ./example project folder

```elixir
defmodule Example.MixProject do
  use Mix.Project

  def project do
    [
      app: :example,
      version: "0.1.0",
      elixir: "~> 1.12",
      start_permanent: Mix.env() == :prod,
      deps: deps()
    ]
  end

  # Run "mix help compile.app" to learn about applications.
  def application do
    [
      extra_applications: [:logger]
    ]
  end

  # Run "mix help deps" to learn about dependencies.
  defp deps do
    [
      # {:dep_from_hexpm, "~> 0.3.0"},
      # {:dep_from_git, git: "https://github.com/elixir-lang/my_dep.git", tag: "0.1.0"}
    ]
  end
end
```

The first section weâ€™ll look at is project. Here we define the name of our application (app), specify our version (version), Elixir version (elixir), and finally our dependencies (deps).

### Interactive

It may be necessary to use `iex` within the context of our application.
We can start a new `iex` session:

```
$ cd example
$ iex -S iex
```

_Starting `iex` this way will load your application and dependencies into the current runtime._

## Compilation

Mix will compile your changes when necessary, but it may sill be necessary to explicitly compile your project.

To compile a Mix project, we only need to run `mix compile` in our base directory.

```
$ mix compile
```

When we compile a project, Mix cretes a `_build` directory for our artifacts.
If we look inside `_build` we will see our compiled application, `example.app`

## Managing Dependencies

To add a new dependency we need to first add it to our `mix.exs` in the `deps`.
Our dependency list is comprised of tuples with two required values and one optional

- The package name as an atom
- The version string
- The optional options

For this example let's look at a project with dependencies, like phoenix_slim:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:phoenix, "~> 1.1 or ~> 1.2"},
    {:phoenix_html, "~> 2.3"},
    {:cowboy, "~> 1.0", only: [:dev, :test]},
    {:slime, "~> 0.14"}
  ]
end
```

The `cowboy dependency` is only necessary during development and test.

Once we've defined our dependencies there is one final step: fetching them.
This is analogous to `bundle install`:

```
$ mis deps.get
```

## Environments

Mix, much like Bundler, supports differing environemtns.
Out of the box Mix is configured to have three enviroments:

- `:dev` -- The default environment
- `:test` -- Used by `mix test`. Covered further in our next lesson
- `:prod` -- Used when we ship our application to production

The current environment can be accessed using `Mix.env`. As expected, the environment can be changed bya the `MIX_ENV` environment variable:

```
$ MIX_ENV=prod mix compile
```
